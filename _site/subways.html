		<p>This is the remnants of a failed attempt at a photo project looking at
Birmingham’s pedestrian subways. I never really thought it was a very good idea
for a project but I decided to take it on because I wanted to try shooting a
project and it was the best idea that I had, and the subways are the sort of
thing that I usually like to shoot anyway.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/ss9679/772aw3" title="Subways 1">

Everything in this series was shot with my Hasselblad 500C/M and Zeiss 60mm
Distagon CF with Ilford HP5+ rated at 800 and developed with Kodak HC-110 at a
dilution of 1+49 for 11 minutes. They were shot on 3 separate rolls of film on 3
different days in May of 2018. I have chosen 12 of the 23 pictures that I took
that I feel fit the scope of the project.</p>

<p><a data-flickr-embed="true" href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/ss9679/L370T7" title="Subways 2">

The intention behind the project was to capture the feeling of the subways,
which I think I was at least partially successful in doing. I think photos 2, 8
and 9 capture some of the dread and uncertainty I, at least used to, feel when
entering one of these. At some point when hunting these things down I began to
realise how quickly they were disappearing, a couple that I photographed were
fenced off and one that I visited had been totally filled in. I was then also
trying to document some of these before they were also demolished. What I failed
to capture was a human aspect of the subways, although I’m not sure that
photographing people walking through these areas or homeless people sleeping in
them would be more compelling than what I have.</p>

I gave up on the project mostly just because I’d lost interest in it. I visited
almost all of the subways that I managed to find, some a few times, and despite
only shooting 23 images I was starting to feel like there wasn’t really any new
compositions left since they’re all quite visually similar.</p>
