This is a pair of photos that I took from the top floor of a pagoda in
小鱼山公园 (Xiaoyushan park, or Little Fish Hill
Park) in Qingdao, China.</p>

      	<p>This series of photographs represents approximately a years worth of work,
starting in <time>April 2016</time> when I got my Hasselblad. I chose to start
then not because I feel that the change of camera increased the quality of
images that I was producing but rather I wanted to keep the format consistent
throughout. Also it was about a year after I started shooting film, and when I
started pursuing photography as a hobby.

      	<p>This is the remnants of a failed attempt at a photo project looking at
Birmingham’s pedestrian subways. I never really thought it was a very good idea
for a project but I decided to give it a go anyway because I wanted to try
shooting a project and it was the best idea that I had, also the subways are the
sort of thing that I usually like to shoot anyway.</p>

I took this photo in Ma Tau Kok, Hong Kong on the way to visit the Kowloon
Walled City Park. I don’t really remember much about my intentions behind the
photo beyond <em>this looks cool</em>, although that is how I shoot most of the time.
In hindsight, I would’ve liked to have framed slightly to the right to show a
bit more of the truck and a bit less of the side of the building but I think
overall the framing is quite interesting. The depth of field puts a slight
softness on the shop fronts which I think works well to make the two guys on the
trucks stand out a bit as well as giving the road, and that piece of litter, a
more noticeable softness in the foreground. The one guy on the right stands out
really well, framed perfectly in front of the white board, but I think the other
guy, especially his head, blends into the background a bit.</p>

<p>I don’t actually know if they are scrap collectors, but that’s what it looks
like to me.</p>
