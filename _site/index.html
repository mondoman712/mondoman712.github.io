      	<p>Having finished my <a href="/portfolio-ii">last portfolio</a> at the end of 2017 I can now
start doing them yearly, so this one covers 2018. This includes two trips to the
Canary islands, one to Gran Canaria in March and another to Fuerteventura in
December as well as another long trip around Asia in the summer.</p>

      	<p>As an astronomy student and hobbyist, light pollution has sort of become my
environmental issue of choice. Not only is it an annoyance to astronomers, but
also damaging to wildlife as well as our health and is a large energy sink. I
have taken particular notice of the amount of light pollution on my university’s
campus lately as I am back living on campus after 2 years of living elsewhere,
and my dissertation involves using the telescope on the roof of the physics
building. This is a university that seems to boast about being <em>green</em> but seems
to ignore this aspect of the environment.

      	<p>In another attempt at post-shooting photo series creation, I have put together a
collection of architecture shots I took during my brief stay in Singapore in
June of 2018.</p>

      	<p>This set of images begins where the <a href="/portfolio-i">last portfolio</a> leaves off
and primarily shows my travels during the summer of 2017, with the last image
being the only one outside of that. I have again chosen to stick to black and
white images taken with my Hasselblad for consistency, and because it’s what I
primary set-up. I am planning on doing one of these with the colour photos that
I’ve taken since I started shooting square format.

This is a pair of photos that I took from the top floor of a pagoda in

      	<p>This series of photographs represents approximately a years worth of work,
starting in <time>April 2016</time> when I got my Hasselblad. I chose to start
then not because I feel that the change of camera increased the quality of
images that I was producing but rather I wanted to keep the format consistent
throughout. Also it was about a year after I started shooting film, and when I
started pursuing photography as a hobby.

      	<p>This is the remnants of a failed attempt at a photo project looking at
Birmingham’s pedestrian subways. I never really thought it was a very good idea
for a project but I decided to give it a go anyway because I wanted to try
shooting a project and it was the best idea that I had, also the subways are the
sort of thing that I usually like to shoot anyway.</p>
