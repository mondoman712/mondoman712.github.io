		<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Orbit determination allows solar system objects to be tracked and studied over
long periods of time, which can give clues into how the solar system formed as
well as evaluate the risk of an asteroid hitting the Earth. The aim of this
experiment is to observe a number of minor planets over multiple nights and use
the positions from the observations to determine orbital elements for the
objects. We did this using the university’s 11” Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope on
a computerised equatorial mount and a colour CCD to collect images of the
main-belt asteroids 30 Urania and 115 Thyra, near-Earth asteroid 433 Eros and
comet 64P/Swift-Gehrels. We observed the objects on 6 separate nights over a
month during October/November 2018. Each night we took around 5 images of each
object to take an average of the positions and to provide redundancy in case any
of the images could not be used. We calibrated our images using AstroimageJ with
dark, flat and bias frames we made during each observation session, in order to
increase the signal to noise ratio in our final images. We then used
Astrometry.net to plate solve our images and AstroImageJ to get the positions of
the objects in each image in celestial coordinates. We entered the average of
the positions from each set of observations into Find Orb in order to get the
orbital elements for each object. The orbital elements we calculated almost all
match those published by the Minor Planet Center to within the calculated
uncertainty. Subsequently we found that we can use our orbital elements to
predict the positions of the objects which should allow us to recover the
objects for the foreseeable future.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>While working on a star catalogue in January 1801, using a 75mm refracting
telescope located in the Royal Palace of Palermo in Italy, Italian priest and
astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi logged a tiny star in Taurus which, on a second
observation the following night, appeared to have moved. Piazzi tracked the
object, making a total of 21 observations, until it moved too close to the
sun to see. Within a few days of each other, around the start of 1802, Franz
von Zach and Heinrich Olbers both used Carl Friedrich Gauss’ predicted
positions, calculated using his newly theorised method of orbit determination,
to recover the object after it returned into view from behind the sun. In March
1802, while making further observations of the object, Olbers noticed a second
small body with similar features which would later become known as Pallas. By
June 1802 Piazzi had managed to convince the astronomical community of the time
that the object he had discovered was a planet and had named it <em>Ceres
Ferdinandea</em> after the patron goddess of Sicily and King Ferdinand of Bourbon,
but it would later become known as just 1 Ceres (Foderà Serio et al., 2002). It was
not until later in the century, once more of these planets had been discovered,
that they were reclassified as asteroids and were designated numbers in order of
discovery.</p>

<p>Johnson et al. (2014, Chapter 26) defines minor planets, or asteroids, as
<em>small, naturally formed solid bodies that orbit the sun, are airless and show
no detectable outflow of gas or dust.</em> In 1947, by which time 2046 asteroids had
been discovered, Paul Herget was asked by the International Astronomical Union
(IAU) to operate the newly founded Minor Planet Center (MPC) which would collect
and distribute measurements of minor planets. It was run by Herget at the
University of Cincinnati until 1978. Today the MPC also handles identification,
designation and orbit determination and currently operates in the Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts and as part of the IAU.</p>

<p>By the mid 20<sup>th</sup> century many astronomers had become bored and
frustrated with asteroids as they frequently interfered with images taken while
photographing other objects in the sky, and there had not been any recent
scientific developments to increase interest in them (Whipple et al., 1968,
Chapter 4). However, since the 1990s interest has grown due to concerns about
the risk of Earth being hit by an asteroid, and there is some commercial
interest as asteroids can contain large amounts of valuable materials and
private space flight is becoming more common. The first dedicated mission to
visit an asteroid was NEAR Shoemaker which orbited 433 Eros in 2000 and landed
on it in 2001. The mission found that Eros is made up of approximately 1.2%
aluminium (McCoy et al., 2001), which is a total of 6.6x10<sup>15</sup>kg or 62
times the amount extracted from Earth since 1973.</p>

<p>Over the past few years there have been multiple missions visiting comets and
asteroids, such as the European Space Agency’s Rosetta probe which orbited comet
67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko along with the Philae lander which performed the first
soft landing on a comet in 2014 (Pérez-Ayúcar et al., 2018). In
January 2019 NASA’s New Horizons mission made a close approach of asteroid
486958, nicknamed Ultima Thule, which is currently the most distant object
visited by a spacecraft (Stern et al., 2018). Also the Japanese Hayabusa2
mission entered orbit around a near-Earth asteroid in June 2018 and intends to
return to Earth with samples from the asteroid in 2020 (Watanable et al., 2017).
All of these missions collect data on the geology of these asteroids which can
give clues into how the solar system was formed.</p>

<p>These missions rely on accurate orbit determination in order to direct the
spacecraft into a close encounter or rendezvous with the solar system objects
that they study.
Orbit determination also allows the tracking and study of objects for longer
periods of time, and the ability to calculate the risk of Earth being hit by an
asteroid.
An object is classified as potentially hazardous if it has a minimum orbit
intersection distance (MOID), the shortest distance between points on two
orbits, with Earth’s orbit of 0.05au or less and an
absolute magnitude of 22 or less (Gehrels et al., 1994).
For asteroids the absolute magnitude uses a reference distance of
1au instead of the more common 10pc used for
interstellar objects.
An absolute magnitude of 22 corresponds to a diameter of around
75-240m; an impact from an asteroid this size could flatten a
city.
There are currently 1969 known potentially hazardous asteroids (PHAs)
listed by the MPC.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="orbital-elements">Orbital Elements</h2>
<p><img src="img/minor-planets/elements.png" alt="elements" /></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Figure 1: A diagram showing the four directional Keplerian orbital elements:
inclination, ι; longitude of the ascending node, Ω; argument of
periapsis, ω; and the true anomaly, ν. The first three describe the
orientation of the orbit in relation to a reference plane, which in this case is
Earth’s orbital plane, and the true anomaly describes the position of the body
in the orbit.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The standard way of describing an orbit is by using the six Keplerian elements
with, in the case of objects orbiting the sun, the Earth’s orbital plane as the
reference plane and the First Point of Aries (0°, 0°
in ecliptic coordinates) as the reference direction.
The elements that describe the shape and size of the orbit are the eccentricity,
$e$, which describes how elongated the orbit is compared to a circle and the
Semi-major axis, <em>a</em>, which is half the diameter across the widest part of the
ellipse.
Alternatively the shape of the orbit can be quantified by the apsis and
periapsis, which are the longest and shortest distances from the orbiting body
to the host body respectively.
In the case of an object orbiting the sun these are known as the aphelion and
perihelion (Bate et al.,1971, Chapter 2.3).</p>

<p>The orientation of the orbital plane is described by the inclination, ι,
which is the angle between the orbital plane and the reference plane measured at
the ascending node, as shown in figure~\ref{fig:elements}.
The ascending node being the point at which the object passes through the
reference plane northwards.
The longitude of the ascending node, Ω, is the angle between the
ascending node and the reference direction.
The ellipse is oriented in the plane by the argument of periapsis, ω,
which is the angle between the ascending node and the periapsis.</p>

<p>The true anomaly, ν, is the angle between the periapsis and the position of
the body at a given time. Alternatively, the time at which the body is at it’s
periapsis can be used.</p>

<p>\subsection{Object Classification}\label{ssec:objclas}
Asteroids are split into different groups based on their location in the solar
system and gravitational relationship to planets.
%Ceres is a main-belt asteroid, which means it is a member of the asteroid belt
%between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
%Ceres is also one of five dwarf planets and the only one in the inner solar
%system.
Near-Earth objects are asteroids or comets with a perihelion distance of
\SI{1.3}{\astronomicalunit} or less.
They can be split into four subgroups based on their orbit compared to Earth’s:
Amors orbit completely outside it, Apollos orbit mostly outside, Atens orbit
mostly inside, and Atiras orbit completely within Earth’s orbit.
Apollos and Amors make up \SI{92}{\percent} of the near-Earth object population.</p>

<p>Trojans are asteroids that are gravitationally locked to one of the major
planets, the largest trojan group being Jupiter’s, with \num{7039} identified
Jovian trojans compared to only 22 identified Neptunian trojans.\footnote{From
	\url{https://minorplanetcenter.net/iau/lists/Trojans.html}, last updated
	\DTMdisplaydate{2018}{10}{28}{-1} when retrieved}
However, it is believed that there could be about 10 times as many large (radius
around \SI{100}{\kilo\metre}) Neptunian trojans as Jovian trojans of the same
size \citep{chiang2005}.
Currently Earth has only one identified trojan, a roughly \SI{200}{\metre} wide
asteroid discovered in 2010, whereas Mars has nine.
They orbit in areas approximately \SI{60}{\degree} in front of and behind the
main body along the same orbit, which corresponds to the fourth and fifth
Lagrange points of the planet’s orbit.</p>

<p>The Kuiper Belt is a group of small objects that exist beyond the orbit of
Neptune, from around \SIrange{30}{50}{\astronomicalunit}, they are rich in water
ice and have similar properties to comets.
The largest members are the dwarf planets Pluto, Makemake, and Haumea.
It is estimated that there are approximately \num{100000} objects at least
\SI{10}{\kilo\meter} in diameter in the Kuiper Belt, but so far only around
\num{1500} have been discovered.
The Kuiper belt is an area of interest at the moment due to the clues that it
could hold on the formation of the main planets and the solar system as a whole
\citep[Chapter~44]{johnson2014}.</p>

<p>Comets are objects that contain volatile materials and have highly eccentric
orbits, such that when they come close enough to the sun the material starts to
sublimate and the comet begins out-gassing.
This can create a nebulous atmosphere around the comet itself that can reach
\SIrange{e3}{e4}{\kilo\metre} and a tail which can be
\SIrange{e5}{e7}{\kilo\metre} long \citep{combi2004}.
These large features, while very diffuse, can be very bright to an observer on
Earth, to the point where they can occasionally be seen in the day time.
Recorded observations date back to 613\BCE{}in China \citep{stephenson1984}.</p>

<p>\subsection{Object Detection and Observation}\label{ssec:odao}
While the telescope was not invented until the \nth{17} century, records of
naked eye observations of comets going back to ancient China can still be used
to calculate the date of their perihelions due to their fast movement across the
sky.
The earliest plausible record of Halley’s comet dates back to 240\BCE{}with more
detailed records not appearing unit 12\BCE.\@
It was Edmond Halley who first recognised the periodicity of comets and
predicted the return of his namesake.
Halley also contributed observations of the Great Comet of 1680 to Newton which
he used in {\it Principia\/} to attempt to determine its orbit.
The telescopes used by Newton and Halley were similar to the one used by Piazzi
to discover Ceres over a century later, being very intricate instruments that
used micrometer microscopes to measure positions.</p>

<p>In the late \nth{19} century German astronomer Max Wolf pioneered
the use of astrophotography to search for asteroids, using a lens intended for
portraiture to get a very large (\SI{12 * 8}{\degree}) field of view compared to
the longer focal length telescopes used by other astronomers at the time, which
allowed him to search the sky much faster \citep{tenn1994}.
The camera would be attached to an equatorial mount, as a telescope would
usually be, which is designed to rotate the camera to move with or perpendicular
to the direction of rotation of the Earth.
This would move the camera with the stars throughout the exposure so any objects
moving relative to the stars would appear as streaks on the photographic plate.
Wolf used this method to discover a total of \num{228} minor planets.</p>

<p>Today sky surveys use computerised telescopes with charge-coupled device (CCD)
cameras in order to automate the process as much as possible.
This allows for objects to be found faster and for dimmer, and therefore smaller
and/or more distant, objects to be discovered.
Currently there are multiple large scale survey projects which have minor planet
detection and tracking as either their primary or secondary goal.
The Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) in Hawaii
repeatedly surveys the visible sky with the primary goal of detecting
potentially hazardous objects \citep{chambers2018b}.
It uses two \SI{1.8}{\meter} telescopes with high resolution CCD arrays in order
to achieve wide fields of view while maintaining a small pixel scale.
This means a large area of sky can be searched whilst still ascertaining very
precise positions.
The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), due to be completed in 2020 in
Chile, has similar goals to Pan-STARRS but increased capabilities.
The LSST will use an \SI{8.4}{\meter} primary mirror to achieve a
\SI{9.6}{\degree} field of view with \SI{0.2}{\arcsecond} pixel scale compared
to Pan-STARRS which has a \SI{3.2}{\degree} field of view with
\SI{1}{\arcsecond} pixel scale \citep{jones2009}.
This should allow the LSST to detect many more solar system objects and detect
potentially hazardous objects significantly earlier than Pan-STARRS.\@</p>

<p>Follow up observations are also often made with more general use observatories,
depending on the interest in the object discovered.
For example the object 1I/2017~U1, or \okina{}Oumuamua, was discovered in 2017
by Robert Weryk with Pan-STARRS.\@
Once \okina{}Oumuamua was determined to be the first interstellar body to be
discovered it generated a lot of interest.
It was first thought to be a comet but follow up observations showed no signs of
outgassing.
This, combined with the small amount of non-gravitational acceleration detected
and its strange cigar-like shape, led to many theories on the nature of the
object, although no consensus has been reached.
Observations were made with the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope, Keck 2
observatory, and United Kingdom Infrared Telescope in Hawaii; the Very
Large Telescope and Gemini South telescope in Chile \citep{meech2017}; as well
as the Spitzer and Hubble space telescopes \citep{trilling2018}.</p>

<p>\subsection{Orbit Determination}\label{ssec:orbdet}
Orbit determination is the calculation of the shape of an orbit using a set of
observations.
The first method for orbit determination was published in Newton’s
{\it Principia\/} in 1687, this method was then refined by Euler in 1744 and
again by Lambert in the 1760s.
Newton’s method involves constructing an intricate diagram from three evenly
spaced observations in order to calculate parabolic approximations of orbits of
comets.
After the discovery of Ceres by Piazzi, Gauss used his method for orbit
determination to calculate positions which were used by both Olbers and von
Zach to recover its orbit following its disappearance behind the sun
\citep{gronchi2005}.
Gauss’ method is also based on the use of three observations to find an orbit,
but it is often combined with the method of least squares, which was also
introduced by Gauss, to determine more accurate orbits using more observations.
Gauss’ method, which he did not publish until 1809, is based on transformations
of the orbiting body’s position vector.
The method of least squares, also devised by Gauss, is used to fit
linear equations to a set of data and it can be applied in conjunction with his
method for orbit determination to acquire a more accurate result.
This allowed Olbers and von Zach to recover Ceres from Piazzi’s 21 initial
observations.</p>

<p>Another method for orbit determination was introduced by the Finnish astronomer
Yrj"o V"ais"al"a in 1939 which uses just two observations to get an
imprecise prediction.
V"ais"al"a’s method is commonly used for newly discovered objects in order to
be able to continually observe the object over the first few nights before a
more accurate determination can be made \citep{bowell2002}.</p>

<p>All of these methods are only used to find preliminary orbits, as they ignore
the effects of other phenomena that may effect the orbit, known as
perturbations.
These perturbations could be caused by the mass distribution within the object,
gravitational effects from other objects, and radiation pressure from the sun
amongst others \citep[Chapter~2.3]{schutz2004}.
Modern methods of orbit determination are usually in the form of computer
programs.
They often use some form of Gauss’ method to find a preliminary orbit with an
N-body simulation to calculate the effect of the perturbations.
The N-body simulation calculates the positions of any number of objects in a
system and their gravitational effects on each other, which can be used to see
how multiple asteroids with similar orbits might interact with one another.</p>

<p>NASA’s New Horizons mission launched in 2006 with the primary goal of performing
a flyby of Pluto, which it did in 2015.
It also had the secondary goal of collecting data on Kuiper Belt objects,
although no suitable candidates were found until June 2014 when the object
\ultima, nicknamed Ultima Thule, was discovered using the
Hubble Space Telescope (Stern et al., 2018).
Just \num{16} months after the discovery, or \SI{0.004}{\percent} of its orbital
period, propulsive manoeuvres were made by New Horizons based on orbital
parameters calculated using observations from this small proportion of the
orbit.
These manoeuvres put the spacecraft on a course to encounter the object to
within \SI{3500}{\kilo\meter}, which it did successfully in January 2019.</p>

<p>\section{Method}\label{sec:method}
The intention of this project was to observe a number of solar system objects
and determine their orbital elements.
In order to do this we made images of a total of 9 different solar system
objects on six nights over a month using the university’s telescope.
We also made a series of calibration images each night in order to remove
artefacts from our final images, which we did by subtracting them from the
images of the objects.
Then we used the images to determine the positions of four of the objects at the
time each image was made, and entered the times and positions into an orbit
determination program.</p>

<p>\subsection{Observation}\label{ssec:obs}
We used an \SI{11}{\inch} Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope (Celestron EdgeHD 1100)
on a computerised equatorial mount (Celestron CGX).
We made observations on six different nights between \DTMusedate{first} and
\DTMusedate{last}.
We used the Minor Planet Center’s observing target list
tool\footnote{\url{https://minorplanetcenter.net/whatsup/index}} each night to
identify and locate potential objects to observe.
The use of known positions was purely to allow us to locate these objects and
did not affect our results.
Due to the fact that we could not predict when we would have suitable weather
for observing, we decided to make observations of about six different objects
each night.
This meant if we were unable to observe any of the objects for any reason
we still had alternatives to look at.
\enlargethispage{1.5\baselineskip}</p>

<p>Before each observation session we would set up the telescope, the first thing
to do was make sure the mount was calibrated.
If the mount is not calibrated correctly it will not point the telescope at the
correct part of the sky when given coordinates.
The calibration routine involved the mount pointing the telescope at where it
thinks a given bright star should be and we would correct manually to make sure
the star is at the centre of the CCD.\@
This was then repeated multiple times to improve the accuracy of the mounts
automated positioning system, known as a go-to system.
The telescope was then focused by pointing it at a bright star and placing a
Bahtinov mask in front of the objective.
The Bahtinov mask creates diffraction spikes which can then be aligned to
achieve optimum focus.</p>

<p>We would then capture various types of calibration images to improve the
signal-to-noise ratio and remove artefacts in our final images.
Dark frames are taken with the same exposure time as the images of the objects
but blocking all light from reaching the sensor.
When subtracted from the light frames, the images of our objects, they make
sure that each pixel on the sensor gives the same value with no light detected.
Bias frames are taken with the sensor or telescope covered like dark frames, but
with the exposure time set to 0.
Subtracting bias frames removes noise generated by the sensor readout.
Flat frames are evenly illuminated to show any dust spots or vignetting in the
final image; we took them by pointing the telescope at the wall of the
observatory with the lights on.
We usually took around five of each of the calibration frames to average out any
random noise in them and to prevent that noise from being incorporated into our
final images.</p>

<p>Each time we went to observe an object we would start by entering the
coordinates from the MPC into the telescope.
We often found that the object would not be in the field of view at this point
and we had to adjust the position of the telescope.
This was due to the telescope mount’s go-to system not being accurate enough for
the small field of view (\SI{27*18}{\arcminute}) we were working with.
The small field of view made it harder for us to locate the objects but
theoretically it should have allowed us to ultimately find more accurate
positions of the objects.
The images from the CCD attached to the telescope are automatically transferred
to the computer in the observatory, on which they are plate solved.
Plate solving is the process of finding the position in the sky of the given
image, which is done by comparing the relative positions of the stars in our
images to a large database of known star positions.
In order to confirm that we had found the target objects we would check the
positions compared to the MPC’s predicted positions and make sure we could see
an object where it should be.</p>

<p>Once we found the target object we would take at least five images of it so we
could later find its average position over the different exposures, and to make
sure that if the telescope were to move slightly during one of our exposures we
still had plenty of images to use.
Most of our exposure times were \SI{30}{\second} but they ranged from
\SI{10}{\second} to \SI{45}{\second} depending on how bright our object was and
how well the telescopes tracking was working.
The tracking in the telescope mount varied slightly depending on how the mount
was positioned.
The apparent brightness of the objects depends on their size, albedo, distance
from the sun and distance from the Earth.
We could only detect objects down to about \nth{15} magnitude so we were limited
in the number of objects that we would be able to detect.</p>

<p>We kept notes on the image files of each object and the exposure times
in a spreadsheet, which we also updated later to include links to each of the
image files for convenience when we went to process them.</p>

<p>\subsection{Data Processing}\label{ssec:data}
We processed the images with the calibration frames in order to achieve the
greatest signal-to-noise ratio, potentially this gives us greater accuracy when
calculating the positions of the objects.
We used a program called AstroImageJ \citep{collins2013} to process the images.
It stacks each of our calibration images into master versions and subtracts
those from the light frames.
Being a colour sensor, the CCD we were using had a Bayer filter, or colour
filter array, which only allows a single colour of light to reach each pixel in
a repeating pattern of red, green and blue.
To convert the monochrome image, that comes from the sensor, into a colour image
we would have to debayer it, which is the process of applying the colour filters
to each pixel in the image file.
We decided not to debayer the images, which could cause the positions we found
to be offset by a pixel if any of our objects were primarily one of the colours
used by the filter.
However this offset is smaller than the size of the stars in our images so it
should not affect our results.
\enlargethispage{0.5\baselineskip}</p>

<p>We then plate solved the images, which AstroImageJ does by uploading the images
to a service called Astrometry.net \citep{lang2012}.
This returns the position of the centre of the image in celestial coordinates,
as well as the angular size of a pixel.
This then allowed us to use AstroImageJ’s centroid tool, which finds the centre
of brightness of an object, to establish the position of our target.
We recorded this in a spreadsheet with the time at which the image was taken.
We decided not to stack the calibrated light frames as some of the objects moved
a noticeable amount from the first frame to the last, this would cause the
object to be elongated and thus reduce the accuracy of the position.
Instead we averaged the positions of the objects in each separate frame.

<p>After finding the average position of the objects for each set of observations
we converted the data into the MPC’s \num{80} column format which allowed us to
enter it into a program called Find Orb \citep{gray2012}.
The \num{80} column format has been in use since the Minor Planet Center was
founded in 1947 and was originally designed for punch card based computers.
We used a spreadsheet to convert our data from the units we recorded the
positions in, to the units required by the 80 column format, and to compile the
data into the format.
We then ran the orbit determination program, Find Orb, with our observations for
each of the objects to ascertain the orbital elements.</p>

<p>The objects that we chose to focus on, from the nine objects that we made
observations of, were 30~Urania, 115~Thyra, 433~Eros, and 64P/Swift-Gehrels.
We chose them because they are the objects for which we had the most data, and
they represent a good selection of different types of objects, Urania and Thyra
being main-belt asteroids, Eros a near-Earth object or more specifically an
Amor, and Swift-Gehrels a comet.
This should give us a spread of different semi-major axes, eccentricities and
orbital periods.</p>

<p>The only control over the uncertainty on the observation data is via the
precision of the figures that were entered, which Find Orb uses to estimate the
error on the positions.
We entered our positions down to \SI{0.1}{\arcsecond} because we found that the
error on the plate solutions of each image was usually around
\SI{1}{\arcsecond}.
The error on the plate solutions were calculated by finding the standard
deviations of a list of correspondences between image and reference stars given
by Astrometry.net.
So with the averaging of multiple results the error will be less than
\SI{1}{\arcsecond}.
Find Orb then gives errors on all of the results, calculated using the distances
between our observations and the orbit, or residuals, except for the period.
We calculated the errors on the periods by propagating the errors from the
semi-major axes.</p>

<p>\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
The orbital elements for the objects calculated using our observations, along
with the uncertainties, are shown in table~\ref{tab:orbel}.
Since they are both main-belt asteroids we expected to see similar periods
and low eccentricities for Urania and Thyra, which is shown by our results.
We also see a lower period for Eros and a larger period and high eccentricity
for Swift-Gehrels, which are expected of near-Earth asteroids and comets
respectively.</p>

<p>Since we were always observing at roughly the same time of night and through a
short portion of the year, we would expect that the objects that were easier for
us to see, i.e.\ that are brighter and further from the horizon, would have
similar longitudes of their ascending nodes.
However the MPC figures for the other objects that we observed shows that there
is more of a spread than shown here, which suggests that the fact that all our
objects were within \SI{10}{\degree} of each other is purely coincidental.</p>

<p>There is quite a large inconsistency in the errors on the results, which could
be due to where in the orbit each of the objects were at the time of observing.
The objects closer to their perihelion will be moving faster relative to the
sun so there will be a larger difference in their positions between our
observations and therefore the calculated orbits should be more accurate.
Urania and Thyra were at perihelion on \DTMdisplaydate{2019}{01}{09}{-1} and
\DTMdisplaydate{2019}{02}{23}{-1} respectively, which is \SI{4}{\percent} of
Urania’s orbit and \SI{7}{\percent} of Thyra’s since our last observation on
\DTMusedate{last}.
This is one possible explanation as to why Thyra generally has a larger amount
of uncertainty in each of the elements than Urania.</p>

<p>\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{figures/orb-el}
	\caption{A plot of our results calculated using our observations in Find
		Orb, divided the results published by MPC for each of our
		objects}\label{fig:orbel}
\end{figure}</p>

<p>Swift-Gehrels reached its perihelion on \DTMdisplaydate{2018}{11}{03}{-1} which
was during the time that we were observing.
Eros reached its perihelion on \DTMdisplaydate{2019}{02}{01}{-1}, which is
\SI{12}{\percent} of its orbit after our last observation, which would suggest
it should have larger uncertainties on the orbital elements than all of the
other objects.
This could be due to Eros’ relative proximity to Earth during the time we
observed it.
Over the observation period Eros was around
\SIrange{0.35}{0.51}{\astronomicalunit} from Earth whereas Urania and Thyra were
both around \SI{1.5}{\astronomicalunit} away.
This meant that Eros appeared to move much more quickly relative to the
background sky, which would then reduce the proportional size of any error on
our observations.\pagebreak</p>

<p>\section{Discussion}\label{sec:disc}
The Minor Planet Center publishes orbital elements for objects calculated using
observations from many sources going back as far as the initial discovery of
Ceres in 1801.
Figure~\ref{fig:orbel} shows each of the orbital elements for each of the bodies
that we calculated divided by those given by the MPC, which are known to a much
higher degree of accuracy than our results.
This comparison shows that our results almost always fit with those from the MPC
to within our calculated uncertainties.</p>

<p>Our results could have improved by taking observations on a greater number of
nights over the same period, although we were limited by when we had good enough
weather to observe.
The best way to improve the accuracy of our determinations would be to make
observations through a larger amount of the target bodies’ orbital periods,
although we were limited in the amount of time we had to make our observations.</p>

<p>\subsection{Errors on our Observations}\label{ssec:err}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{figures/obs}
	\caption{A graph of the deviations from the mean position of each set of
		observations.
		The centre square shows the size of a pixel in our images
		(\SI{0.57}{\arcsecond}), the inner red circle shows the error on
		the plate solutions (\SI{1.37}{\arcsecond}) and the outer black
		circle shows the average standard deviation of each set
		(\SI{1.46}{\arcsecond}).}\label{fig:deviations}
\end{figure}
Since Find Orb will only estimate the error on each observation based on the
precision of the positions given, we rounded all of our positions to
\SI{0.1}{\arcsecond} under the assumption that the error would be less than
\SI{1}{\arcsecond}, based on the errors of the plate solutions.
Figure~\ref{fig:deviations} shows positions of our objects in each observation
compared to the mean position of that set of observations and compares that to
the average plate solution error, average standard deviation and pixel size.
The fact that the average plate solution error and the average standard
deviation are very similar suggests that the primary source of random error on
each of our observations could be the plate solution.</p>

<p>The average distance from our observed position to the MPC’s predicted position,
for the same object at the same time, is \SI{8.6}{\arcsecond}.
This distance is caused by any inaccuracies in the predictions from the MPC,
which could have been created by perturbations, and any systematic error that
could have occurred in our observations.
The systematic error could have come from how the positions of the stars and
objects within the images were calculated, which would effect both the plate
solutions and the acquisition of the position of the target object in the image.
\pagebreak</p>

<p>One potential way to reduce uncertainty on the positions of stars and our target
objects is to reduce the size of the stars in the image.
The average full width at half maximum (FWHM) of Urania in our images was
\SI{5.8}{\arcsecond}.
Improving the optics used and imaging under better atmospheric conditions would
decrease the FWHM, giving us more accurate positions.
We had an issue with the telescope throughout our observations which caused
stars towards the edges of the frame to be elongated, in order to reduce the
effects of this we were careful to make sure our objects were close to the
centre of the image, however it still could have contributed to random and
systematic errors in our plate solutions.</p>

<p>\subsection{Object Recovery}\label{ssec:rec}
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\input{figures/ephemeris}
	\caption{A graph showing the distance between our predicted positions of
		the objects and where MPC expects them to be.}\label{fig:diff}
\end{figure}
One further test of the accuracy of our orbital elements is to look at the
predicted positions to see if we could recover the objects at a later date, in
the same way that Ceres was recovered in 1801/1802 (see
Section~\ref{ssec:orbdet}).
Since we are no longer making any more observations we have compared our
predicted positions to those published by the Minor Planet Center.
This comparison, covering just over 3 years after our last observation, is shown
in figure~\ref{fig:diff}, which gives the largest distance between predicted
positions as \SI{48}{\arcsecond}, which is much less than the
\SI{18}{\arcminute} field of view of the university’s telescope sensor on the
short edge.
This shows that our observations, taken over the space of a month, would be
enough to continue to find an object for the at least the next three years.
This would be useful in the case of a newly discovered object that may not be
observable for a while, perhaps due to it moving behind the sun relative to the
Earth, so the object could be found once it is visible again, as was the case
with 1~Ceres.</p>

<p>This, however, does not take into account any perturbations which may change the
orbital elements over time and cause both our predictions and the MPC’s to be
incorrect.
We found that while making our observations 64P/Swift-Gehrels’ position would be
noticeably different to that published by the MPC which was likely due to
outgassing as it was close to perihelion while we observed it.
This was not a problem for the other objects as they were not outgassing and
generally have more regular orbits as they are less eccentric and therefore
are less likely to encounter other objects which may effect their orbits.
\pagebreak</p>

<p>\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}
Orbit determination is important because it allows us to track and study objects
for longer periods of time and assess the risk of Earth being hit by an
asteroid.
Also the calculation of orbits of solar system objects and spacecraft allows for
missions to make close encounters or rendezvous with distant objects such as the
New Horizons mission’s close encounter with Ultima Thule.</p>

<p>During this project we successfully managed to determine orbital elements for
the objects 30~Urania, 115~Thyra, 433~Eros and 64P/Swift-Gehrels using
observations we made on 6 nights over a month in October/November 2018 using the
university’s observatory.
The orbital elements we found almost all agree with those published by the Minor
Planet Center to within our calculated uncertainty.
We also calculated that the predicted positions of the objects based on our
orbital elements agree with those published by the MPC to within the field of
view of the university’s telescope for at least three years.
This suggests that we would be able to use our predictions to find the objects
for future observation, which is an important part of the process of discovering
new solar system objects.</p>

<p>One way in which we could extend this project would be to look at other
categories of objects, such as the Jovian trojans, the moons of Jupiter or
Saturn, or a Kuiper Belt object.
The brightest Kuiper Belt object, Pluto, reaches about \nth{14} magnitude at its
brightest.
This means it would be possible for us to observe however due to its extremely
long orbital period we would need a longer amount of time to get an accurate
orbit.<br />
The largest Jovian trojan, 624~Hektor, ranges in apparent magnitude from around
\num{12} to approximately \num{16}, which is brighter than the
\nth{14} magnitude of Swift-Gehrels when we observed it, and there are many
other Jovian trojans that can be bright enough for us to observe.
Jupiter’s four largest moons, known as the Galilean moons after their
discoverer, would be easily visible with the university’s telescope being bright
enough to be seen with the naked eye, if they were not so close to their much
brighter host.
They have short orbital periods ranging from \num{1.7} days to \num{18} days.
Jupiter also has many smaller moons although only four more could be bright
enough for us to observe.
Observing moons has another advantage, for the most part, all the moons of a
given planet would be visible within the field of view of the telescope at one
time allowing us to make more observations of the objects in the same amount of
time.</p>
