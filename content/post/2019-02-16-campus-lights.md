As an astronomy student and hobbyist, light pollution has sort of become my
environmental issue of choice. Not only is it an annoyance to astronomers, but
also damaging to wildlife as well as our health and is a large energy sink. I
have taken particular notice of the amount of light pollution on my university's
campus lately as I am back living on campus after 2 years of living elsewhere,
and my dissertation involves using the telescope on the roof of the physics
building. This is a university that seems to boast about being _green_ but seems
to ignore this aspect of the environment.

All of the photos in this series were taken between 11pm and 2am, outside of
those times of the year when things stay open through the night (around exams
and big deadlines) and mostly away from the residential areas, so this should
show the darkest the university gets within term time.

I have been in contact with a relevant member of staff about the situation and
they seemed to be very receptive to this and I am awaiting an update. My main
goal with this project is to raise some awareness for this issue while also
documenting what the campus looks like before it hopefully gets darker.
