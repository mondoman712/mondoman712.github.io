It's 5 months since I posted my project [Campus Lights](/campus-lights). Sadly I
didn't manage to make any progress with getting anything changed on campus, the
person I'd emailed didn't get back to me and my exams & dissertation took
precedence so I didn't pursue it any further.

I did manage to write a slightly extended version of the article for
[Emulsive](https://emulsive.org/articles/campus-lights-documenting-local-light-pollution-on-film),
for which I also swapped out a couple of photos. I consider this to be the final
version of the project and I am very happy with how it turned out.

Also reddit user [ISUOnFilm](https://www.reddit.com/user/ISUOnFilm) created
[their own version](https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/axqfab/campus_lights_2_my_version_of_a_project_by/)
of the project which I think turned out really well.

The following 3 photos are ones that I took for the project, didn't make it into
the final cut but I still wanted to share.

Overall I am very pleased with how the project turned out and with how it was
received. My main goal with projects going forward is to try something longer
term, and I hope to revisit the topic of light pollution at some point.
