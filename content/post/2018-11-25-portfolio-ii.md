This set of images begins where the [last portfolio](/portfolio-i) leaves off
and primarily shows my travels during the summer of 2017, with the last image
being the only one outside of that. I have again chosen to stick to black and
white images taken with my Hasselblad for consistency, and because it's what I
primary set-up. I am planning on doing one of these with the colour photos that
I've taken since I started shooting square format.

All of these images were shot on Ilford HP5+, and all but the last one pushed to
ISO 800, which has become something of a default for me. Also, all [but
one](#gordon) of these images were shot with the 150mm lens, which I bought in
March of 2017 and also used for the last four images in [Portfolio
I](/portfolio-i). I seem to use both of the lenses I own for my Hasselblad (the
60mm and 150mm) pretty evenly but I find most of the images that I take that I
really like have been with the 150mm.
