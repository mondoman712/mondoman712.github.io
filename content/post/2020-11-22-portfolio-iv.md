2019 was another active year for me, with a trip to Venice in July and then a
long trip to Barcelona, the U.S, Vietnam, Thailand but mostly Taiwan. I only
shot colour film in Vietnam and Thailand so those won't appear here, and my film
from Thailand was actually the first film I've posted to a lab due to running
out of chems and Corona, and they were annoyingly lost before they made it
there.

I didn't do as much towards photo series in 2019 as I would've liked to. I did
make together my [New York Architecture post](/ny-architecture) and put together
[a series of images I shot in Nottingham](/edgeland-nottingham) since I started
studying there. I did think about starting a series many times throughout the
year but I left Nottingham in June and didn't know where I was going to be in
the longer term so I didn't want to start anything big that I wouldn't be able
to finish.

As usual all of these images were, again, shot with my Hasselblad 500C/M and
60mm CF and 150mm CF lenses on Ilford film. Mostly HP5+ at 400 or 800, but the
last shot is at 3200, and two in the middle are Pan F+.
