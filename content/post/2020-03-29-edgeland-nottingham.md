I was recently looking through all the photos I took during my 4 years living in
Nottingham to see if I could come up with some kind of series out of them. After
cutting it down to all the black & white images that turned out reasonably I had
just over 200 photos so I needed to come up with some more specific ideas. One
theme I tend to shoot a lot is where nature meets the built environment, which
lead me to put together this series. I got the title, and some inspiration, from
[Robin Friend's Bastard
Countryside](https://www.robinfriend.co.uk/bastard-countryside) (watch [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkS_jxaej90) for a good introduction).

This series was shot with my Hasselblad 500C/M, CF 60mm and 150mm lenses, and
Ilford HP5+ at EI 800 and developed in HC-110 1+49 for 11 minutes, except for
[image 13](#13), which was shot on Ilford FP4+ at EI 400 and developed in HC-110
1+49 for 16 minutes.

In Feburary 2019 I started shooting a series with a similar theme in a small
nature reserve in Nottingham on Fuji Pro 400H, but I've never been able to get
acceptable scans from the 2 rolls I shot. If I do manage to get something useful
from them I might put together a part 2 to this project.
