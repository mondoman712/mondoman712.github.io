Having finished my [last portfolio](/portfolio-ii) at the end of 2017 I can now
start doing them yearly, so this one covers 2018. This includes two trips to the
Canary islands, one to Gran Canaria in March and another to Fuerteventura in
December as well as another long trip around Asia in the summer.

2018 is also the year during which I started to become more interested in
collections of images rather than just single photos. I shot two rather short
projects over the year, [Subways](/subways) and [Campus Lights](/campus-lights).
I also attended a photo sequencing workshop at The Photo Parlour in Nottingham
as part of the Off-Centre photo festival during which we looked at a selection
of prints of my photos taken in China, which I have continued to work on.

As usual all of these images were shot with my Hasselblad 500C/M and 60mm CF and
150mm CF lenses on Ilford film, although with a bit more variation that last
year as I have included one shot taken on Delta 100 and one on Pan F+ but the
rest are my usual HP5+. There's also more photos taken with my 60mm lens
included this year than there was last year.
