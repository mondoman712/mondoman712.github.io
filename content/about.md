This site was built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with a modified
[Anubis](https://github.com/mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis) theme (with credit to
the [monochrome](https://github.com/dyutibarma/monochrome) which this site used
to be based on, [leejo.github.io](https://leejo.github.io) and the default
[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) theme which were both inspirations for
this theme), and is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
