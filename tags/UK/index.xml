Sadly I
didn&amp;rsquo;t manage to make any progress with getting anything changed on campus, the
person I&amp;rsquo;d emailed didn&amp;rsquo;t get back to me and my exams &amp;amp; dissertation took
precedence so I didn&amp;rsquo;t pursue it any further.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I did manage to write a slightly extended version of the article for
&lt;a href="https://emulsive.org/articles/campus-lights-documenting-local-light-pollution-on-film">Emulsive&lt;/a>,
for which I also swapped out a couple of photos. I consider this to be the final
version of the project and I am very happy with how it turned out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Also reddit user &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ISUOnFilm">ISUOnFilm&lt;/a> created
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogCommunity/comments/axqfab/campus_lights_2_my_version_of_a_project_by/">their own version&lt;/a>
of the project which I think turned out really well.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Overall I am very pleased with how the project turned out and with how it was
received. My main goal with projects going forward is to try something longer
term, and I hope to revisit the topic of light pollution at some point.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Campus Lights</title><link>/campus-lights/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/campus-lights/</guid><description>&lt;p>As an astronomy student and hobbyist, light pollution has sort of become my
environmental issue of choice. Not only is it an annoyance to astronomers, but
also damaging to wildlife as well as our health and is a large energy sink. I
have taken particular notice of the amount of light pollution on my university&amp;rsquo;s
campus lately as I am back living on campus after 2 years of living elsewhere,
and my dissertation involves using the telescope on the roof of the physics
building. This is a university that seems to boast about being &lt;em>green&lt;/em> but seems
to ignore this aspect of the environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of the photos in this series were taken between 11pm and 2am, outside of
those times of the year when things stay open through the night (around exams
and big deadlines) and mostly away from the residential areas, so this should
show the darkest the university gets within term time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been in contact with a relevant member of staff about the situation and
they seemed to be very receptive to this and I am awaiting an update. My main
goal with this project is to raise some awareness for this issue while also
documenting what the campus looks like before it hopefully gets darker.&lt;/p>

Birmingham&amp;rsquo;s pedestrian subways. I never really thought it was a very good idea
for a project but I decided to give it a go anyway because I wanted to try
shooting a project and it was the best idea that I had, also the subways are the
sort of thing that I usually like to shoot anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/ss9679/772aw3" title="Subways 1">
&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1875/44447904432_9f203051d9_b.jpg"
alt="Subways 1">&lt;/a>
&lt;p>&lt;br>&lt;br>
Everything in this series was shot with my Hasselblad 500C/M and Zeiss 60mm
Distagon CF with Ilford HP5+ rated at 800 and developed with Kodak HC-110 at a
dilution of 1+49 for 11 minutes. This is what I shoot most of the time anyway
but I thought that the pushed HP5+ would work well for the sort of gritty feel
of the subways. I shot 3 separate rolls of film on 3 different days in May of
2018. I have chosen 12 of the 23 pictures that I took that I feel fit the scope
of the project.
&lt;br>&lt;br>&lt;/p>
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/ss9679/L370T7" title="Subways 2">
&lt;img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1900/43780054014_f946c62a8e_b.jpg"
alt="Subways 2">&lt;/a>
&lt;br>&lt;br>
The intention behind the project was to capture the feeling of the subways,
which I think I was at least partially successful in doing. I think photos 2, 8
and 9 capture some of the dread and uncertainty I, at least used to, feel when
entering one of these. At some point when hunting these things down I began to
realise how quickly they were disappearing, a couple that I photographed were
fenced off and one that I visited had been totally filled in. I was then also
trying to document some of these before they were also demolished. The main
thing that I failed to capture was a human aspect of the subways, although I'm
not sure that photographing people walking through these areas or homeless
people sleeping in them would be more compelling than what I have.
&lt;br>&lt;br>
&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/gp/ss9679/uMop8f" title="Subways 3">

alt="Subways 4">&lt;/a>
&lt;br>&lt;br>
I gave up on the project mostly just because I'd lost interest in it. I visited
almost all of the subways that I managed to find, some a few times, and despite
only shooting 23 images I was starting to feel like there wasn't really any new
compositions left since they're all quite visually similar.
