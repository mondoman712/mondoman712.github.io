environmental issue of choice. Not only is it an annoyance to astronomers, but
also damaging to wildlife as well as our health and is a large energy sink. I
have taken particular notice of the amount of light pollution on my university&rsquo;s
campus lately as I am back living on campus after 2 years of living elsewhere,
and my dissertation involves using the telescope on the roof of the physics
building. This is a university that seems to boast about being <em>green</em> but seems
to ignore this aspect of the environment.</p></div><div class=article-date>16 Feb 2019</div></article><article class=post-list><header><h1><a href=/burmese-dogs/>Burmese Dogs</a></h1></header><div class=content><blockquote>"The pariah curs were baying the moon - it was only a quarter full

Birmingham&rsquo;s pedestrian subways. I never really thought it was a very good idea
for a project but I decided to give it a go anyway because I wanted to try
shooting a project and it was the best idea that I had, also the subways are the
sort of thing that I usually like to shoot anyway.</p></br><a href=https://www.flickr.com/gp/ss9679/772aw3 title="Subways 1"><img src=https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1875/44447904432_9f203051d9_b.jpg alt="Subways 1"></a></div><div class=article-date>07 Sep 2018</div></article></main><footer class=site-footer><p>Â© Sam Smith, 2020</p><nav><a href=/tags/ title=Tags>Tags</a>
