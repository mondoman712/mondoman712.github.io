This series of photographs represents approximately a years worth of work,
starting in <time>April 2016</time> when I got my Hasselblad. I chose to start
then not because I feel that the change of camera increased the quality of
images that I was producing but rather I wanted to keep the format consistent
throughout. Also it was about a year after I started shooting film, and when I
started pursuing photography as a hobby. <!--break-->

Between taking these photos at least a year and a half ago, compiling this
series 6 months ago and now, my opinion of these images doesn't seem to have
changed too much. I think I can put this down to the memories I have attached to
these photos and the fact that I didn't take a whole lot else that was any good.
